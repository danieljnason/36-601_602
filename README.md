# 36-601 and 36-602
Perspectives in Data Science I and II

This repository contains work completed for the final projects for both 36-601 and 36-602.

36-601's project is about predicting bike availability in Washington D.C. This was initially a group project that I redid on my own time and expanded to include additional months and a new modeling process. The file contains my code for cleaning, exploring, and modeling the data along with the relevant data sets.

36-602's project is from a Kaggle case competition data set of employee attrition and is a joint effort between myself and Caleb Pena.
