# 36-601 and 36-602
Perspectives in Data Science I and II

This repository contains work completed for the final projects for both 36-601 and 36-602.

36-601's project is about predicting bike availability in Washington D.C., while 36-602's project is from a Kaggle case competition data set of employee attrition. I redid the 36-601 project initially and expanded the scope of the analysis to include more months, while the 36-602 project as a joint effort between myself and Caleb Pena.
